# Fraud-Transaction-Detection
I recently completed a project focused on detecting credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. The goal was to create a model that accurately identifies potentially fraudulent transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset.



Key Highlights:

Models Used: Logistic Regression

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

Results:

Accuracy: 99%

Precision for Fraudulent Transactions: 13%

Recall for Fraudulent Transactions: 90%

F1-score for Fraudulent Transactions: 23%

Tools and Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn



What I Learned:

The challenges of working with imbalanced datasets and the importance of techniques like SMOTE for handling class imbalance.

How to effectively evaluate model performance using various metrics, especially in the context of fraud detection.

Gained hands-on experience in the end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.



Outcomes and Conclusions:

While the model achieved a high accuracy, it struggled to effectively identify fraudulent transactions, as indicated by low precision and F1-score for the minority class.



Future improvements could involve experimenting with different algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering to enhance the model's performance.
